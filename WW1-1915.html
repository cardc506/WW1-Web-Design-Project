        <p>The decision to join the fray on the side of the Allies was based
          largely on the assurances Italy received in the Treaty of London,
          signed in April 1915. By its terms, Italy would receive the fulfillment
          of its national dream: control over territory on its border with
          Austria-Hungary stretching from Trentino through the South Tyrol to
          Trieste. In addition, the Allies promised the Italians parts of Dalmatia
          and numerous islands along Austria-Hungary’s Adriatic coast; the Albanian
          port city of Vlore (Italian: Valona) and a central protectorate in Albania;
          and territory from the Ottoman Empire.</p>

        <p>On May 23, 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. The Italian
          declaration opened up a new front in World War I, stretching 600
          kilometers—most of them mountainous—along Italy’s border with
          Austria-Hungary. Italy—which had become a unified nation only as recently
          as 1859—was, like Russia, not yet a fully industrialized power. It was
          certainly not prepared for large-scale warfare, and although it managed
          to mobilize 1.2 million men in the spring of 1915, it possessed equipment
          for just 732,000. Upon declaring war, the Italian army immediately advanced
          into the South Tyrol region and to the Isonzo River, where Austro-Hungarian
          troops met them with a stiff defense. The snowy and treacherous terrain made
          the region poorly suited to offensive operations, and after several quick
          Italian successes, combat settled into a stalemate.</p>
