      <p>World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 after the
        assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. His murder
        catapulted into a war across Europe that lasted until 1918. During the
        conflict, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire
        (the Central Powers) fought against Great Britain, France, Russia,
        Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States (the Allied Powers).
        Thanks to new military technologies and the horrors of trench warfare,
        World War I saw unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction. By
        the time the war was over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more
        than 16 million people—soldiers and civilians alike—were dead.</p>

        <p>When World War I broke out in the summer of 1914, Italy declared
          itself neutral in the conflict, despite its membership in the
          so-called Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary
          since 1882. Over the course of the months that followed, Italy and
          its leaders weighed their options; wooed by both sides, they carefully
          considered how to gain the greatest benefit from participation in the
          war. The decision to join the fray on the side of the Allies was based
          largely on the     assurances Italy received in the Treaty of London,
          signed in April 1915. By its terms, Italy would receive the fulfillment
          of its national dream: control over territory on its border with
          Austria-Hungary stretching from Trentino through the South Tyrol to
          Trieste. In addition, the Allies promised the Italians parts of Dalmatia
          and numerous islands along Austria-Hungary’s Adriatic coast; the Albanian
          port city of Vlore (Italian: Valona) and a central protectorate in Albania;
          and territory from the Ottoman Empire.</p>

        <p>The Battle of the Somme, which took place from July to November 1916,
          began as an Allied offensive against German forces on the Western Front
          and turned into one of the most bitter and costly battles of World War
          I. <br>
          British forces suffered more than 57,000 casualties—including more
          than 19,000 soldiers killed—on the first day of the battle alone,
          making it the single most disastrous day in that nation’s military
          history. By the time the Battle of the Somme (sometimes called the
          First Battle of the Somme) ended nearly five months later, more than
          3 million soldiers on both sides had fought in the battle, and more
          than 1 million had been killed or wounded.</p>

        <p>Two days after the U.S. Senate voted 82 to 6 to declare war against
          Germany, the U.S. House of Representatives endorses the declaration
          by a vote of 373 to 50, and America formally enters World War I.<br>
          When World War I erupted in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson pledged
          neutrality for the United States, a position that the vast majority
          of Americans favored. Britain, however, was one of America’s closest
          trading partners, and tension soon arose between the United States
          and Germany over the latter’s attempted quarantine of the British
          Isles. Several U.S. ships traveling to Britain were damaged or sunk
          by German mines, and in February 1915 Germany announced unrestricted
          warfare against all ships, neutral or otherwise, that entered the war
          zone around Britain. One month later, Germany announced that a German
          cruiser had sunk the William P. Frye, a private American vessel.
          President Wilson was outraged, but the German government apologized
          and called the attack an unfortunate mistake.</p>

        <p>World War I (1914-1918) was finally over. This first global conflict
          had claimed from 9 million to 13 million lives and caused unprecedented
          damage. Germany had formally surrendered on November 11, 1918, and all
          nations had agreed to stop fighting while the terms of peace were negotiated.
          On June 28, 1919, Germany and the Allied Nations (including Britain, France,
          Italy and Russia) signed the Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the war.
          (Versailles is a city in France, 10 miles outside of Paris.) Do you know what
          triggered the conflict, sometimes called the "Great War"?</p>
