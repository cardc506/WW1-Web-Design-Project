        <h3>Why it Started</h3>

        <p>The spark that ignited World War I was struck in Sarajevo, Bosnia,
          where Archduke Franz Ferdinand—heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire—was
          shot to death along with his wife, Sophie, by the Serbian nationalist
          Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. Princip and other nationalists were
          struggling to end Austro-Hungarian rule over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
          The assassination of Franz Ferdinand set off a rapidly escalating chain
          of events: Austria-Hungary, like many countries around the world, blamed
          the Serbian government for the attack and hoped to use the incident as
          justification for settling the question of Serbian nationalism once and
          for all.</p>

        <h3>After the Fact</h3>

        <p>Convinced that Austria-Hungary was readying for war, the Serbian
          government ordered the Serbian army to mobilize and appealed to Russia
          for assistance. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia,
          and the tenuous peace between Europe’s great powers quickly collapsed.
          Within a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia had
          lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and World War I had begun.</p>
