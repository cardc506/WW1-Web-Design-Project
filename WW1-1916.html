        <p>Battle of Verdun, (February 21–December 18, 1916), World War I
          engagement in which the French repulsed a major German offensive.
          It was one of the longest, bloodiest, and most-ferocious battles of
          the war; French casualties amounted to about 400,000, German ones to
          about 350,000. Some 300,000 were killed.<br>
          German Gen. Erich von Falkenhayn believed that the war would be won or
          lost in France, and he felt that a strategy of attrition was Germany’s
          best hope of achieving its goals. In a letter to German Emperor William
          II in late 1915, he argued that Britain was the most formidable of the
          Allied powers, but he conceded that it could not be assaulted directly,
          save by submarine warfare, as the British sector of the Western Front
          did not lend itself to offensive operations (an assessment that would
          be proved correct at the First Battle of the Somme). In Falkenhayn’s
          view, Britain’s “real weapons” in the war were the French, Russian,
          and Italian armies. He regarded Russia as already paralyzed and Italy
          as unlikely to affect the outcome of the war, concluding, “Only France
          remains.” Falkenhayn stated that a breakthrough en masse was unnecessary
          and that instead Germany should bleed France to death by choosing a point
          of attack “for the retention of which the French would be compelled to
          throw in every man they have.”</p>

        <h3>Battle of Somme</h3>

        <p>Prior to the attack, the Allies launched a week-long heavy artillery
          bombardment, using some 1.75 million shells, which aimed to cut the
          barbed wire guarding German defenses and destroy the enemy’s positions.
          On the morning of July 1, 11 divisions of the British 4th Army (many
          of them volunteer soldiers going into battle for the first time) began
          advancing on a 15-mile front north of the Somme. At the same time, five
          French divisions advanced on an eight-mile front to the south, where the
          German defenses were weaker.<br>
          Allied leaders had been confident the bombardment would damage German
          defenses enough so that their troops could easily advance. But the
          barbed wire remained intact in many places, and the German positions,
          many of which were deep underground, were stronger than anticipated.
          Along the line, German machine gun and rifle fire cut down thousands
          of the attacking British troops, many of them caught in no man’s land.</p>
