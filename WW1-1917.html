        <p>On May 7, the British-owned Lusitania ocean liner was torpedoed
          without warning just off the coast of Ireland. Of the 1,959 passengers,
          1,198 were killed, including 128 Americans. The German government
          maintained that the Lusitania was carrying munitions, but the U.S.
          demanded reparations and an end to German attacks on unarmed passenger
          and merchant ships. In August, Germany pledged to see to the safety of
          passengers before sinking unarmed vessels, but in November sunk an Italian
          liner without warning, killing 272 people, including 27 Americans. With
          these attacks, public opinion in the United States began to turn irrevocably
          against Germany.</p>

        <p>On June 26, the first 14,000 U.S. infantry troops landed in France to
          begin training for combat. After four years of bloody stalemate along
          the western front, the entrance of Americaâ€™s well-supplied forces into
          the conflict marked a major turning point in the war and helped the
          Allies to victory. When the war finally ended, on November 11, 1918,
          more than two million American soldiers had served on the battlefields
          of Western Europe, and some 50,000 of them had lost their lives.</p>
